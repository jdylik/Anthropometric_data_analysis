# Anthropometric_data_analysis
Project was created for the Biomedical Engineering in practice course on fourth semester at Silesian University of Technology. The purpose of the project was to analyze the anthropometric data to get to know whether there is relationship between excess weight and weight of lower limbs muscles. Further step was to create a few Machine Learning models and compare their results with a few rates of model performance.

Data are not the part of the project files as there was not given a permission from the teacher to share it in public.
Data are in form of measurements of pupils in school age. Children are measured every couple of days to monitor their physical development. 
Exemplary features: height, neck circumference, arm skinfold, chest width.

Used R modules:
- corrplot,
- PerformanceAnalytics,
- caTools,
- class,
- rpart,
- rpart.plot,
- e1071.


Applied models:
- KNN,
- Decision Tree,
- SVM (linear kernel),
- SVM (polynomial kernel).
